# BrokenRecordBot
reddit copypasta bot for subreddit wiki text

All you need for this bot is Python and PRAW.
You'll need to edit praw.ini with your username/password and script credentials.

The stream.py file can be left running and will monitor your user stream for new mentions, then reply if a keyword is recognized with the corresponding wiki text.
